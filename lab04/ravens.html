         <h2>2nd Image</h2>
         <p>This page will have my first image that is related to the Ravens.</p>
        <img src="images/ravens.jpg" alt="image of ravens team" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>When I first linked the image and I hit show preview the image was covering the whole page 
        and I wasnt sure if it was something I had to change in my css file but something useful was
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp"> W3 Schools</a> and noticed I had to
        do it through the img tag using style and changing the width and length.
        </p>
        <h2>About the Image</h2>
        <p> So, about the image it is a jpg I used it as a jpg because it contains many colors especially in the background, the picture was about the defense so they probably made a good play and celebrated as a team.</p>
