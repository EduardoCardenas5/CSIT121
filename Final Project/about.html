    <h2>How PixelForge Started</h2>
    <p>
      PixelForge Studios began as a small group of friends who enjoyed building tiny game prototypes in their free time. 
      What started as a hobby slowly grew into a shared passion, and eventually the group decided to form a small studio to bring their ideas to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than focusing on large scale productions, we prefer smaller projects where we can experiment, take creative risks and learn as we go. Each game begins with one simple question: “What kind of experience would be fun or interesting to explore?”

    <h2>How We Develop</h2>
    <p>
      Our workflow is collaborative and flexible. We sketch ideas, test mechanics, and rebuild things as needed. 
      Every project evolves naturally through trial, feedback, and iteration nothing is rushed, and nothing is created purely to follow trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also focus on comfort and accessibility. Good settings, readable text, and simple control options help more people enjoy what we create.

     Our workspace is simple and practical. We use a mix of software tools along with a basic setup that includes a laptop, drawing tablet, and desktop computer to take our ideas from rough concepts to playable builds.
