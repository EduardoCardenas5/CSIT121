      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        In this project, one of my main challenges was keeping the layout
        consistent across all four pages while changing the content for a
        fictional indie game studio. Once I set up a header and footer that I
        could reuse it was easier to manage the site and make updates.
        Another challenge was just coming up with ideas based on my "company" and team.
      </p>

      <h3>Testing on Different Devices</h3>
      <p>
        I tested the site on both a laptop and a phone and in more than one
        browser. On a smaller screen the content stacked in a single column
        which made it easier to scroll through.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned Overall</h3>
      <p>
        Overall from everything I learned from the past semester I tried putting onto here.
        This wasnt the worst project because its a lot of repetition, like navigation bars, fonts, css and a lot more.
        So, most of this stuff we have went over from previous labs but putting it all together from previous labs
        and making a more professional and somewhat realistic page was cool and fun.
