                This is my first webpage! I think so far the most difficult thing would be the
                header and what to put with that, i was also getting the header confused with the head.
                Also i was unsure if to put my h2 and h3 in the main and article but i did because
                i feel like its right and thats where my important information starts with my webpage.
            </p>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A thing i learned was the structure
                    of an html page.
                </li>
                <li>Another useful thing I learned,
                    its more of a tip but using the html:5 and
                    its very useful for structure.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Resources I Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Creating_the_content">Basic
                        HTML</a>
                </li>
                <li>Another resource would just be in class and listening
                    to the professor explain how things work.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <header>
            <h2>Lab 3</h2>
          </header>
          <p>This is my third lab and in this lab I will be using css to style my webpage and make it look more appealing. As well as using my previous knowledge of HTML from Lab02.</p>
          <p id="special"> Using CSS could be a little challenging having to flip through my CSS page and my HTML page. </p>
          <p>Another <span class="highlight">challenge</span> would be adding <span class="highlight"> highlights</span> to your text because it could be kinda confusing.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            A useful resource I used was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">W3 Schools CSS Tutorial</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
