                <p>
                    This is my first webpage! I think so far the most difficult thing would be the
                    header and what to put with that, i was also getting the header confused with the head.
                    Also i was unsure if to put my h2 and h3 in the main and article but i did because
                    i feel like its right and thats where my important information starts with my webpage.
                </p>
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A thing i learned was the structure
                        of an html page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Another useful thing I learned,
                        its more of a tip but using the html:5 and
                        its very useful for structure.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Resources I Used:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a

                            HTML</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Another resource would just be in class and listening
                        to the professor explain how things work.
                    </li>

                <h2>Lab 3</h2>
                <p>This is my third lab and in this lab I will be using css to style my webpage and make it look more
                    appealing. As well as using my previous knowledge of HTML from Lab02.</p>
                <p id="special"> Using CSS could be a little challenging having to flip through my CSS page and my HTML
                    page. </p>
                <p>Another <span class="highlight">challenge</span> would be adding <span class="highlight">
                        highlights</span> to your text because it could be kinda confusing.</p>
                <h3>Resources I Used:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A useful resource I used was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">W3 Schools CSS
                            Tutorial</a>
                    </li>

            </article>
            <article id="lab5">
                <h2>Lab 5</h2>
                <p>For this lab I did a responsive layout using flexbox and media queries. My goal is to make the page look good on mobile and desktop devices.</p>
                <h3>Resources I Used:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A resource I used was just practice in the module 5 folder it had a lot of practice in it.</li>
                    <li>I also used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox">Developer Mozzila</a> for some additional help.</li>
