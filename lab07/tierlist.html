    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This tier list ranks my top QBs for 2025. Lamar Jackson is #1 thanks to his all around dominance and leadership.
        Mahomes and Allen are close behind, while Burrow remains a steady star. Drake Maye is a breakout candidate who
        could surprise people this season. These rankings will always spark debate that's what makes football fun.</p>
