    <h2>What Is WebRTC?</h2>

    <p>
      WebRTC stands for Web Real Time Communication and it lets browsers instantly share audio, video or data. It's a real web standard made to work the same across browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. 
      Before WebRTC existed people had to install plug ins just to join a video call. 
      Now the browser already knows how to handle all of that. That's why it's become a simple and fast way to communicate online.

      One of the biggest parts of WebRTC is that it uses peer-to-peer connections. This means the data goes directly between people instead of always passing through a big server in the middle.
      Browsers use things like ICE, STUN and TURN behind the scenes to figure out how to connect to each other. Most users don't ever notice this it just works. It helps keep the connection fast and stable.

      WebRTC isn't only for video calls. It supports voice calls, screen sharing and even regular data like text or files. That's why so many apps rely on it everything from video apps to collaborative tools. 
      Developers also like it because the API is simple and doesn't require expert level networking knowledge. With all these features WebRTC has become a key part of many real time apps on the web.
