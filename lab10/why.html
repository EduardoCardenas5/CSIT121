    <h2>Why Is WebRTC Important?</h2>

    <p>
      WebRTC is important because it lets people connect instantly without needing to install anything. If someone wants to join a video call or chat, they can just open their browser and go.
      This makes things way more convenient and less stressful for users. It also helps sites load faster since everything is built in.
      For a lot of modern websites, having real-time communication is basically expected.

      It also plays a big role in remote work, online classes, and telehealth. Tools used for meetings or tutoring sessions often rely on WebRTC to connect people.
      Since it works on phones, tablets, and laptops, almost anyone can join without trouble. Whether someone is using a personal device or a school computer, it usually works the same.
      This makes WebRTC a dependable technology for many different situations.

      Security is another reason WebRTC matters. Everything—audio, video, and data—is encrypted automatically.
      That means it helps protect private conversations or screens from being accessed by others. Users don't have to do anything extra to stay secure because the browser handles it.
      This built-in safety makes WebRTC a trusted way to communicate online.
