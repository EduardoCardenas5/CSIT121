      WebRTC is basically the technology that lets people talk video chat, or share things right in the browser without installing anything. You've probably used it in apps like Google Meet or when a website asks to use your camera. Since it works inside most browsers everything loads fast and feels pretty smooth. It also removed the need for old plugins or extra downloads. Now it powers a lot of things we use for school, work and everyday communication.

      What makes WebRTC really useful is that almost anyone can access it since it runs on phones, tablets and computers. People don't have to stress about downloading apps or setting things up. This makes online communication way easier especially for people who aren't technical. Developers like it too because they can build video and voice features directly into their sites. So it ends up helping both the user and the people building the tools.

      This site breaks down WebRTC in a simple way. Each page focuses on a different part of it so everything is clear. You'll see what WebRTC is, why it matters, and examples of how websites use it. The idea is to make it understandable without getting difficult to understand it. By the end hopefully ive made it simple for you to have a good sense of why WebRTC is such a big deal on the modern web.
